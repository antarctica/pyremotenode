Log flush to system during sleep process didn't work properly
Flash deployment to TS7400
BUG: Fix the planner action to ensure tasks are scheduled for the next day when already passed for the current day, applies to timed tasks
improve time handling for sleeping in relation to the RTC drift
Tuning for timeout response with modem failure is too long, ate up remaining time despite lack of responses whilst waiting for registration.
Need to implement dependency processing for sleep activities
BUG: a failed baseline wasn't resent the next day on SBD failure (because it assumes to be retried), though outstanding baselines that hadn't started sending were = statefulness error!
BUGS: LoH processing needs to be identified as failed and VHF failure tolerance needs improving. !!!
BUG: Deploy the fix for the issue with the scheduler that results in job failure for the days statically timed jobs when planning an all-nighter!
Review cumulative modem usage in failure scenarios.
